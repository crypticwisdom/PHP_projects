# PHP_projects
This folder contains my PHP and MySQL projects.

There are few requirements needed before you can view each project:
1. Localhost server with MySQL support, installed on your machine.
2. Note the name of the folder where you get the MySQL file.
3. Create a new Database called "Exactly the name of the folder where you got the MySQL file from".
4. Unzip and Import the MySQL database file into the new Database in your MySQL database Management system (DBMS).
5. You can now run the project through your Local Server.
